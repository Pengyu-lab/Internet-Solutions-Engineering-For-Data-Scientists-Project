<h5>Book sharing website

(Internet-Solutions-Engineering-For-Data-Scientists-Project)


This project creates a website that facilitates social engagement in the remote COVID world. Through, a social library portal that allows you to store and organise books while connecting you with likeminded book lovers. You are responsible for implementing the following three user stories that define how an editor typically accesses and uses the portal:

i. A user signs into their social books portal and adds a book to their personal library. They add the book with title, author(s), year, ISBN, abstract and personal tags for metadata. Books can be edited and deleted.

ii. Based on the metadata tags, topics are formed that are automatically turned into topical subsections of the user’s own personal library. The user can browse them instead of the entire personal library. Because each book can have multiple metadata tags, it can be in multiple topical subsections at the same time and changing tags will automatically change their topical subsections.

iii. Each user has a social section where they see other users’ books. Only users’ books are selected if the user shares at least 3 books with that other user. The other users’ books can be browsed using the metadata tags.
